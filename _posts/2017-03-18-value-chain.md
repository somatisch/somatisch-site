There has been a lot written on positioning, market making, the relationship of a start up to a market etc...

One of the more interesting approaches to positioning is that of [value chain mapping] http://www.cio.co.uk/it-strategy/introduction-wardley-value-chain-mapping-3604565/

It not the most intutitve approach, but it is a useful one that brings together a couple of key ideas.

- first it situates an effort within an embedded value graph -

>The key to economic action is that producers seek market niches to maximize profit and minimize competition.  As they do so, they base production decisions not only on anticipated costs from suppliers and anticipated demand from buyers, but also by looking at their competitors.  producers act less in response to actual demand than by anticipating it  gauge where competitors have found demand and thus determine what they can do that is similar â€¦..and yet  different enough to give themselves a special niche
