## Valuation Methods and Tools

Valuation lies at the  the intersection of strategy and finance.  For many technologists and entrepreneurs without a background in the particular vernacular of finance, valuation can seem strange, with its own language and manners and people who dress in suits, even when they do not wear them.

This cultural aversion, is however misplaced. Instead,  valuation should be understood as  a language  for articulating business value to stakeholders.  It is important to understand valuation as it relates to raising capital, interpreting term sheets, planning acquisitions, developing business partnerships, defining exit strategies, or determining employee compensation.

This article from [McKinsey](http://www.mckinsey.com/) provides a [useful primer](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/valuing-high-tech-companies) on valuation and especially Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.

Here at somtisch.io, we partner with and use tools such as [Equidam](https://www.equidam.com/) to help companies understand and articulate their valuations, and provide them access to CFO functions and skills that are often hard to find.

Understanding the art of valuation is an important skill to develop, and one that should be embraced as part of the varied skill set of an entrepreneur.
