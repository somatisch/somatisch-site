  We construct the site naviagion by loading a list of the site's pages
  and filtering to just those with the front matter of:
    group: "in_local_navigation"
  and we order by adding
    order: 2 (whatever number)
  {% endcomment %}
  {% assign navigation_list = site.pages | sort:"order" %}
  {% assign group = 'in_local_navigation' %}
  {% include navigation_list.html %}
</ul>
