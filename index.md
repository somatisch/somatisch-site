# somatisch.io
organic, minimalist, business and solution architecture
>Helping clients  with the *hard* problems


## what is architecture?
![alt text](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/68/22/24/6822240df3cc3a802ab8415034c2050c.jpg "A Pattern Language,Christopher Alexander ")

There have been many names given to this role as it applies to business, solution, and product management.  Most recently the term ["Design Thinking"](https://hbr.org/2008/06/design-thinking) is en vogue. Previous iterations included ["Systems Thinking"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KZn46u7wKw) or "Holistic Design".

Whatever the latest language, an architect's role, whether creating or validating a business model, modeling an enterprise, designing a product, or defining a solution, is to deeply consider, lead, and frame processes and systems that deliver desired outcomes.

Because well-designed systems are dynamic, the architect also defines the way an orgnization gathers value from a system's feedback loops as well as take advantage of new powerful postive externalities.

Stated simply, a good architect delivers solutions that:

- improve over time
- enable new and novel value creation
- from strategy to task to outcome.

## approach
The somatisch.io approach brings together two key aspects of effective strategy to task execution:

1. **Understanding**: providing rigorous, pragmatic, model and method driven analysis
2. **Energy**: helping clients realize decisions  by generating the momentum to execute a course of action

The somatisch.io [practice](/recipes/practice) is based on the following characteristics:

  Specific
  : guides practitioners and participants with actions, methods, models, and heuristics - all of which we call recipes.

  Learning focused
  : specifies actions as part of patterns that can be learned and executed.

  Outcome driven
  : analyzes outcomes and data that result from actions and reconstructs the patterns that produced them.

  Evolutionary
  : adjusts, iterates, and evolves patterns to drive toward desired outcomes.

  Discursive and constructive
  : works with clients to develop the assumptions that inform patterns and recipes.

  Pragmatic and applied
  : made to be implemented in the real world and grounded in practical application.
