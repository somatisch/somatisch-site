# somatisch.io
outcome driven, organic, minimalist, business and solution architecture
>Helping clients  with the *hard* problems
________________________


### what is architecture?
There have been many names given to this role as it applies to business, solution, and product management.  Most recently the term ["Design Thinking"](https://hbr.org/2008/06/design-thinking) is en vogue. Previous iterations included ["Systems Thinking"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KZn46u7wKw) or "Holistic Design".

Whatever the latest language, an architects role is to deeply consider,  lead, and frame a design process that results in systems that deliver desired outcomes. And because well designed systems are dynamic, the architect also provides the tools that help organizations to continue gathering value from from the feedback loops of those systems.

### approach
The somtisch.io approach brings together the two key aspects of effective strategy to task execution: Understanding and Energy.

_Understanding_ 
- providing rigorous, pragmatic, model and method driven analysis

_Energy_  
- helping clients realize decisions  by generating the momentum to execute a course of action

- specific – guides practitioners and participants with actions, models, and recipes (heuristics)
- learning focused – specifies actions as part of patterns that can be learned and executed.
- outcome driven – analyze outcomes and data that result from actions and reconstruct the patterns that produced them.
- evolutionary– iterate and evolve based on patterns that result in desired outcomes.
- discursive and constructive – modify the conversations, models, and patterns we are in, or enter into new patterns
- pragmatic and applied – grounded in practical application
