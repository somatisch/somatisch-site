# somatisch.io
outcome driven, organic, minimalist, business and solution architecture
>Helping clients  with the *hard* problems


## what is architecture?
There have been many names given to this role as it applies to business, solution, and product management.  Most recently the term ["Design Thinking"](https://hbr.org/2008/06/design-thinking) is en vogue. Previous iterations included ["Systems Thinking"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KZn46u7wKw) or "Holistic Design".

Whatever the latest language, an architects role is to deeply consider,  lead, and frame a design process that results in systems that deliver desired outcomes. And because well designed systems are dynamic, the architect also provides the tools that help organizations to continue gathering value from from the feedback loops of those systems.

## approach
The somatisch.io approach brings together the two key aspects of effective strategy to task execution: Understanding and Energy.


**Understanding** - providing rigorous, pragmatic, model and method driven analysis

**Energy** - helping clients realize decisions  by generating the momentum to execute a course of action

The somatisch.io practice is based on the following characteristics:

- specific – guides practitioners and participants with actions, methods, models, and heuristics - all of which we call recipes.
- learning focused – specifies actions as part of patterns that can be learned and executed.
- outcome driven – analyzes outcomes and data that result from actions and reconstructs the patterns that produced them.
- evolutionary – adjusts, iterates, and evolves patterns to drive toward desired outcomes.
- discursive and constructive – modifies the assumptions that informa patterns we are in to construct new patterns
- pragmatic and applied – made to be implemented in the real world and grounded in practical application.
